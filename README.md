# used_car_prices_prediction
I have created a Jupyter notebook that imports the data set for used cars. 
I have cleaned up the data and performed feature engineering on top of it to identify 
which columns to keep and which columns to drop or use one hot encoding. 
Finally, I performed Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to see if I get a good match. It matches 59% accuracy.
Then I tried Random Forest and it provided 89% accuracy.
